README for direcctory truncation-scripts
This directory contains a bunch of files I generated while doing the folowing:
-Working on understanding Alan's truncation and capping script
-Trying to make my own truncation and capping script using ChatGPT, PyMOL, and tLeap.
-Working on a python script to clean up the files generated by Alan's bash script. Initial
    analysis indicates an extra ACE and NME in each.
